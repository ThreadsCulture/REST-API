    Please e-mail engineering@threadsculture.com to receive a client ID and secret to access the API. You must have an active Threads account with a admin user credentials to use this API.
    
    For bug reports and feature requests, please use our github repo issue tracker at: https://github.com/ThreadsCulture/REST-API/issues
    
    # OAuth Authentication
    API Authentication is done via an OAuth token. To retrieve an oauth token, send an HTTP `POST` request to `https://YOUR-COMPANY-PORTAL.ourthreads.com/oauth/token`
    
    This request should have the following query parameters:
    * `client_id` - Client ID
    * `client_secret` - Client secret
    * `grant_type` - Should always be "password"
    * `email` - The e-mail address of the user account the API will function on behalf of
    * `password` - The password of the user account the API will function on behalf of
    
    Note that these parameters should be sent in the query string of the request, not as POST data. cURL example:
    
    ```
    curl 'https://YOUR-COMPANY-PORTAL.ourthreads.com/oauth/token?client_id=de65bb7b6f420d9caf5305ca342f71c95f516bb7459aaa4e7bab969bdce59cf5&client_secret=fd63d92e98fadba9914e3f89212cf5d1d574c0f9f861bd9c9a2ef796fd281757&grant_type=password&email=example%40threadsculture.com&password=abcd1234' -X POST
    ```
    
    [Fully constructed sample URL](https://YOUR-COMPANY-PORTAL.ourthreads.com/oauth/token?client_id=de65bb7b6f420d9caf5305ca342f71c95f516bb7459aaa4e7bab969bdce59cf5&client_secret=fd63d92e98fadba9914e3f89212cf5d1d574c0f9f861bd9c9a2ef796fd281757&grant_type=password&email=example%40threadsculture.com&password=abcd1234)
    
    If successfully authenticated, you will receive the following JSON response body:
    
    ```
    {
    	"access_token": "f49648148cc056fd2a585b102ab9e7ab327cb0c89c204af4b42cf5d57b881e72",
    	"token_type": "bearer",
    	"expires_in": 7200,
    	"created_at": 1475085093
    }
    ```
    
    Once a token is retrieved, it should be placed in the HTTP `Authorization` header prefixed by the word 'Bearer' of every HTTP request:
    
    `Authorization: Bearer 7dd917ca6702e8cdf6e66892afad723ec85b8e3fe6104bcb2d53bf64f4a76680`
    
    Example cURL request:
    
    ```
    curl 'https://YOUR-COMPANY-PORTAL.ourthreads.com/api/v1/org_chart' -H 'authorization: Bearer 7dd917ca6702e8cdf6e66892afad723ec85b8e3fe6104bcb2d53bf64f4a76680' 
    ```
    
    Tokens expire after 2 hours.
